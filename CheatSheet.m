%This is how you comment

% It's vector based so variables are vectors (arrays) by default
a = 3;
b = [1 2 3 4 5];
% the ; stops the line's results being printed to the colsole

mat = zeros(a, a);
% fills mat with an axb matrix with each value 0


if a == 4
    %do something
elseif a == 5
    %do something else
else
    %do a different thing
end
  

for i = 1: 10
    %do this each time
end
